This repository contains solutions and exercises focused on advanced array concepts and operations in JavaScript.
Whatâ€™s Inside

    Array methods like .map(), .filter(), .reduce(), .find(), .some(), and others

    Complex array manipulations and transformations

    Use of callback functions and higher-order functions with arrays

    Practice with nested arrays and multidimensional array handling

    Real-world problem solving using arrays

Purpose

These tasks aim to deepen understanding of JavaScript arrays beyond the basics, preparing for more complex coding challenges and real projects.
How to Use

    Each task is implemented in a separate file or function with clear comments.

    You can run these files individually to test the solutions.

    Modify or extend the code to experiment with different approaches.
